# RedditBot

This is a random experiemental project designed to interact with Reddit programatically. 

This project is a pseudo 'notification center'. It pulls weather data, and top posts from a few selected subreddits.

## Why?

I started this project to learn how to interact with Reddit via code.  This knowledge could be extremely useful in the future as you can leverage
reddit, and programming, to analyze internet trends, archive reddit posts, server as an automod bot, etc.
